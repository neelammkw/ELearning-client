I would like to share with you a new full-stack website that I have developed using Next.js and MongoDB as the backend.

This platform comes with a complete Admin Panel that allows:

Adding, editing, and deleting users and courses

Managing front-end content such as the Hero section, FAQs, and Categories

Viewing analytics of invoices, users, and courses


On the user side, the platform includes:

Profile section with options to update name, password, and view purchased courses

Secure course purchase and access to video content

Ability to add reviews and ratings on videos, along with threaded replies to reviews


Overall, the site is designed to be a complete course management and learning platform with both admin control and user-friendly features.
